      <strong>Pulse</strong> is a simple tool to help update people who are affected by disruptive events such as natural disasters, terror attacks, and wars.
    </p>
    <p>After signing up, you can easily <strong>check in</strong> whenever you need to let people know how you are.</p>
    <p>Your profile page is public, and anyone can see your updates.</p>
    <p>If you have someone's user-name, you can <strong>search</strong> for it and we'll take you to their profile page.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Pulse makes no guarantees for information accuracy, and provides this service as a helpful tool whose reliability cannot be assured. You use this service entirely under your own responsibility.</p>
    <p>Pulse <strong>will not act</strong> upon users' information, and is <strong>not a replacement for local emergency services.</strong></p>
